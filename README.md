# Bike Share with Python

## Overview
This repository presents a thorough analysis of bike share usage data. The analysis examines various aspects of the data, such as ride durations, user types, and temporal trends in bike usage.

The dataset includes records of bike rides that occurred over several months. These records contain information about each ride, such as its start and end times, duration, start and end station names, types of bikes used, and whether the user was a casual rider or a member.

## Methodology
The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, statistical testing, and time series decomposition to uncover underlying patterns and trends. The following key steps were taken:
- Cleaning missing data and handling outliers.
- Creating new features such as ride duration, day of the week, and month.
- Aggregating data to explore usage patterns by user type and bike type.
- Statistical analysis to compare the behaviour of casual riders versus members.

## Key Findings
- **Ride Duration Differences**: Casual users tend to have significantly longer ride durations compared to members. A t-test confirms the difference is statistically significant (p-value < 0.01).
- **Usage Over Time**: The heatmap of rides by hour and day of the week indicates peak usage during specific times, suggesting potential patterns in commuter behavior or leisure activities.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Ride durations and the number of rides vary by month, with higher activity seen during warmer months, suggesting a seasonal impact on bike share usage.
- **User Behavior**: Casual users are more likely to use docked bikes, while members prefer classic and electric bikes. This difference in preference could inform the bike fleet composition and station stocking strategies.
- **Statistical Significance**: The statistical analysis provided insights into the differences in ride duration between casual users and members, with casual users typically engaging in longer rides.

## Visualizations
The repository includes a series of visualizations that help to illustrate the insights and findings from the analysis.

## Conclusions
The analysis provides valuable insights for bike share companies to optimize operations and marketing strategies. Understanding user behavior, particularly the differences between casual users and members, can aid in making data-driven decisions to improve service and user satisfaction.
